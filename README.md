Hello myself Bandi sravan kumar reddy and poily vikas and ganga reddy we have done a project about INSTANT PLASMA DONOR REC .IPIENT CONNECTOR WEB APPLICATION under guidelines of J.NARASIMHARAO our project is about instant recover form covid-19.The world is suffering from COVID-19 crisis, and we have not found any vaccine yet. But there is another scientific way from which we can help to lower the death ratio or help the COVID-19 affected person is by donating plasma from recovered patients. With no approved antiviral treatment plan for the deadly COVID-19 infection, plasma therapy is an experimental approach to treat COVID-19 positive patients and help them recover faster. The therapy is considered to be safe and promising. If a particular person is fully recovered from COVID-19, he/she is eligible to donate their plasma. In the proposed system, donors who need to donate plasma can donate by uploading COVID-19 certificate and blood bank can view donors and can raise requests to donors and the hospital can register/login and can search for the plasma, they can raise requests to blood bank and can get the plasma.
